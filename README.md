# Mnemonic Passwords

Simple little Python module that creates strong, mnemonic passwords. Along with the password, you're provided with a
reminder phrase. For example, if your generated password is `82!FiteGako65`, then your reminder phrase would be 
`eighty-two bang fite gako sixty-five one`. As you can see, the reminder is pronounceable (well, sort of). Now let's
look at how to get to the correct password, using the reminder phrase.

`eighty-two` - Our password starts with two digits: 8 and 2.  
`bang` - An exclamation mark (see list of special characters with their respective names below).  
`fite` - The first of two words with a length of 4 characters per word.  
`gako` - The second word.  
`sixty-five` - The last two characters of our password are again two digits: 6 and 5.
`one` - This last number indicates that you have to capitalize the first letter of each word (`Fite` and `Gako`). 
Remember, this number is not part of the password.

If you've done everything correctly, the resulting password shoulde be `82!FiteGako65`.

**Names of the Special Characters**

```
bang        !
star        *
pound       #
at          @
dot         .
dash        -
comma       ,
paragraph   ยง
```

## Installation

After downloading or cloning the repository, change into the downloaded directory (the one with the setup.py file in it)
and run

```
pip install .
```

This will install the module and also make the command-line tool `new-password` available.

## Usage

### Command Line

To generate a password on the command-line, simply type

```
new-password --words=3 --wordlen=4 --capitalize=yes
```

If you need a reminder what the arguments do or how to use `new-password`, simply type:

```
new-password --help

usage: new-password [-h] [--words WORDS] [--wordlen WORDLEN]
                    [--capitalize CAPITALIZE]  
  
Generate strong, easy to remember passwords
  
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --words WORDS, -w WORDS
                        The number of words in the password.
  --wordlen WORDLEN, -l WORDLEN
                        The length of each word.
  --capitalize CAPITALIZE, -c CAPITALIZE
                        Whether or not to add capital letters to the password.
```

All arguments are optional. The default values for the arguments are:

* words = 2
* wordlen = 4
* capitalize = yes

### In your Python code

If you want to use the password generator in your Python scripts, you can do the following:

```
from mnemonic_passwords import generate_password

password, reminder = generate_password(words=3, wordlen=5, capitalize=False)

print(password)
print(reminder)
```

This should result in an output like this:

```
d@kocavbesucxopob46
d at kocav besuc xopob forty-six
```
